This web page calculates the total bill, including tax and tip, based on user input for the bill amount.
        
  How the Console is Used:
- We use the JavaScript console to:
  1. Display prompts to the user for bill amount input.
  2. Calculate the taxed bill, tip, and final bill total.
  3. Check for valid user input and handle errors.
  4. Display results and debugging information using console.log statements.
